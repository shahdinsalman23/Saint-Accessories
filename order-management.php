                    <p><b>1. Can I change the items on my order?</b></p>
                    <p>After your order is placed, we're unable to add items, remove items, or change the color of any products.</p>
                    <p><b>2. Account Dashboard</b></p>
                    <p>You may adjust your shipping and billing addresses, check your most recent orders, change your password, and access your account information from your account dashboard after logging in.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Update My Address</b></p>
                    <p>Send us an email at help@SaintAccessories.com straight soon if you need to update your address, and we'll try our best to accomplish it for you. Despite our best efforts, we cannot guarantee that the address will be updated once an order has been placed because orders are processed rapidly. Once the order has left our warehouse, we are 100% unable to modify addresses. Although we are unable to change the location where your product is being sent, we do advise getting in touch with the carrier or your local post office to set up a forwarding address for shipments in the future!</p>
                    <p><b>4. Cancel my order!</b></p>
                    <p>Until your order is recorded as dispatched, we can cancel it. Send a quick email to help@SaintAccessories.com with your order number. Orders are dispatched fast from our fulfillment center. However, we will try our best to fulfill your request. Once an order has been listed as shipped, we are unable to cancel it.</p>
                    <p><b>5. Returns</b></p>
                    <p>Products may be returned for any reason, up to 15 days after delivery, unopened and unused. Send an email to help@SaintAccessories.com with the subject "Return Request," and we'll provide you with the return address and further instructions.</p>
                    <p>For your return to be accepted:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The product(s) must be unused and in its original packaging.</li>
                        <li>The product(s) must be in its original packing</li>
