                    <p><b>1.	Shipping Cost</b></p>
                    <p>Prices are only provided here for domestic consumers. Please go to our international FAQ for information about other countries.</p>
                    <p>Our free/flat-cost shipping service employs USPS for door-to-door delivery and UPS for the first distribution. Depending on your location and the volume of mail being delivered, this service might take 3–10 business days (up to 2 weeks) to reach you.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the amount of your order, we provide flat-rate delivery for orders under $50 for $5 or $10. Free delivery is available for purchases over $50!</p>
                    <p>Do you require your order by a specific date? No issue! We provide two upgrade choices. For delivery in 3-5 business days (up to one week), select UPS Ground; for even quicker delivery, select UPS 2nd-Day Air. Please be aware that PO boxes and APO items cannot be shipped using enhanced shipping options.</p>
                    <p><b>2.	Production & Shipping Timeframes</b></p>
                    <p>Orders are sent Monday through Friday during regular business hours. Orders that contain all in-stock products will be delivered in 1-2* business days. We do not split ship. Thus orders, including back-ordered goods, may take anywhere from 1-2 weeks to 1-2 months. If you re-order an item or think about making two separate transactions, please be prepared to wait.</p>
                    <p>We provide free delivery for domestic purchases over $50 and flat-cost shipping for orders under $50. Depending on the region and postal service volume, Free/Flat Rate Shipping takes 3–10 business days. Our free/flat-cost shipping service employs USPS for door-to-door delivery and UPS for the first distribution.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, UPS Ground (3-5 business days) and UPS Second-Day Air are our two expedited delivery options. Please be aware that orders sent to PO boxes cannot be shipped with enhanced shipping options.</p>
                    <p>Shipping costs for international consumers vary depending on the location and the products. For additional information, please go to our International FAQ.</p>
                    <p>You will be sent a confirmation email as soon as your order ships with a tracking number so you can follow the progress of your package! Please send an email to help@SaintAccessories.com with the subject "MISSING TRACKING LINK" if you do not receive a confirmation email. Include the entire name that was used to place the order as well as the order's placement date in the body.</p>
                    <p>*Note: If there is a surge in orders (such as on 4/20 or around Christmas), processing time may increase to 3 business days.</p>
                    <p><b>3.	How do I track my order?</b></p>
                    <p>Once your order ships, you'll get an email with a tracking number as a shipment confirmation. Through your account's order history, you may also follow your order! If you're still experiencing issues, send an email to help@SaintAccessories.com with the subject "Missing Tracking Link" and your purchase number.</p>
                    <p><b>4.	Can I ship to more than one address?</b></p>
                    <p>Per order, we only deliver to one address. You should submit numerous orders if you need to ship to different addresses.</p>
                    <p><b>5.	Can I ship to an APO address?</b></p>
                    <p>Yes! Please choose our flat rate/free delivery option. For APO locations, kindly don't choose any UPS shipping options. Please take note that the address part of our label does indeed say "Saint Accessories."</p>
